        communicate, discover and share. People have so many dreams. We want to
        make you achieve your dreams, by writing down your goals, and we make
        you follow them by creating your own task to attain that goal. Also, we
        want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that
        you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who
        and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you
        create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of
        that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you
        might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Drmurs, based on things that you and others do on and off Drmurs.

        when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that
        work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as
        harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have –

      <h5>Ensuring access to our Service.</h5>
      <p>
        To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across
        our systems around the world, including outside of your country of
        residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and
        essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or
        operated by Iconic Dream Focus, Inc., Iconic Dream Focus Pvt. Ltd., or
        their affiliates.

        We use data from Drmurs and other Iconic Dream Focus Company
        Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers
        and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you.

      <h5>How our Service is funded</h5>
      <p>
        Instead of paying to use Drmurs, by using the Service covered by
        these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses
        and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Iconic Dream Focus
        Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about
        your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to
        you. We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who
        you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell
        us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want
        to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be
        interested. We also provide advertisers with reports about the
        performance of their ads to help them understand how people are
        interacting with their content on and off Drmurs. For example,
        we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers
        to help them better understand their audience. We don't share
        information that directly identifies you (information such as your name
        or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies
        who you are) unless you give us specific permission. You may see branded
        content on Drmurs posted by account holders who promote products
        or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner
        mentioned in their content.

      <h5>Why Drmurs?</h5>
      <p>
        Drmurs is a goal tracking app with free photo and video sharing
        app facility on iPhone and Android. People can upload photos or videos
        to our service and share them with their followers or with a select
        group of friends. They can also view, comment and like posts shared by
        their friends on Drmurs. Anyone 13 and older can create an
        account by registering an email address and selecting a username
      </p>
      <h5>Can I have access to my teen’s Drmurs account?</h5>
      <p>
        We appreciate your concern for your child's use of our app, but
        unfortunately, we can't give you access to the account or take any
        action on the account at your request. We're generally forbidden by
        privacy laws against giving unauthorized access to someone who isn't an
        account holder. Please note that all users ages 13 and older are
        considered authorized account holders and are included in the scope of
        this policy. Instagram requires everyone to be at least 13 years old
        before they create an account (in some areas, the age limit may be
        higher).

        ZD Community Guidelines
      </h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health
        emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect
        people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19.
        We're working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to
        real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination
        of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying
        and harassment, and misinformation that contributes to the risk of
        imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we
        continue to look at content on the platform, assess speech trends and
        engage with experts, and will provide additional policy guidance when
        appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this
        crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>The short</h5>
        We want Drmurs to continue to be an authentic and safe place for
        inspiration and expression. Help us foster this community. Post only
        your own photos and videos, and always follow the law. Respect everyone
        on Drmurs; don't spam people or post nudity.
      </p>
      <h5>The long</h5>
      <p>
        Drmurs is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures,
        ages and beliefs. We've spent a lot of time thinking about the different
        points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone. We
        created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect
        this amazing community. By using Drmurs, you agree to these
        guidelines and our Terms of Use. We're committed to these guidelines and
        we hope that you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in
        deleted content, disabled accounts or other restrictions. In some cases,
        we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against
        our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public
        interest. We only do this after weighing the public interest value
        against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights
        standards to make these judgments. • Share only photos and videos that
        you've taken or have the right to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, you own the content that you post on Drmurs. Remember
        to post authentic content, and don't post anything that you've copied or
        collected from the Internet that you don't have the right to post. •
        Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience. We
        know that there are times when people might want to share nude images
        that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons,
        we don't allow nudity on Drmurs. This includes photos, videos
        and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse,
        genitals and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some
        photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding,
        birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for
        example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation
        surgery) or an act of protest are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings
        and sculptures is not permitted too. People like to share photos or
        videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we
        may remove images that show nude or partially nude children. Even when
        this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others
        in unanticipated ways. • Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.
        Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers
        or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly
        contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent. Don't
        offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers,
        comments or other engagement. Don't post content that engages in,
        promotes, encourages, facilitates or admits to the offering,
        solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.
        You don't have to use your real name on Drmurs, but we do
        require Drmurs users to provide us with accurate and up-to-date
        information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the
        purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others. • Follow the
        law. Drmurs is not a place to support or praise terrorism,
        organised crime or hate groups. Offering sexual services, buying or
        selling firearms, alcohol and tobacco products between private
        individuals, and buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs
        are also not allowed. We also remove content that attempts to trade,
        co-ordinate the trade of, donate, gift or ask for non-medical drugs, as
        well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the
        recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical
        drugs. Drmurs also prohibits the sale of live animals between
        private individuals, although brick-and-mortar shops may offer these
        sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species
        or their parts. • Respect other members of the Drmurs community.
        We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that
        contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private
        individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to
        blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do
        generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in
        the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or
        chosen activities. It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone
        based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender
        identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities or
        diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise
        awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express
        your intent clearly. Serious threats of harm to public and personal
        safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm
        as well as threats of theft, vandalism and other financial harm. We
        carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when
        determining whether a threat is credible. • Maintain our supportive
        environment by not glorifying self-injury. The Drmurs community
        cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult
        issues such as eating disorders, cutting or other kinds of self-injury
        come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part
        by providing education in the app and adding information in the Help
        Centre so people can get the help they need. Encouraging or urging
        people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support,
        and we'll remove it or disable accounts if it's reported to us. We may
        also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if
        the content targets them for attack or humour. •
        <h5> Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</h5>
        We understand that many people use Drmurs to share important and
        newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images.
        Because so many different people and age groups use Drmurs, we
        may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure that Drmurs stays appropriate for everyone. We understand that people often
        share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate. If
        you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your
        photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for
        sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.
        <h5>Help us keep the community strong:</h5>
        <p>
          Each of us is an important part of the Drmurs community. If
          you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please
          help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global team
          that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove
          content that doesn't meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you
          know doesn't have a Drmurs account, you can still file a
          report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much
          information as possible, such as links, usernames and descriptions of
          the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove
          entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our
          guidelines. • You may find content that you don't like, but doesn't
          violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can unfollow or
          block the person who posted it. If there's something that you don't
          like in a comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment. •
          Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between
          members of the community. If one of your photos or videos was posted
          by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the
          person to take it down. If that doesn't work, you can file a copyright
          report. If you believe that someone is violating your trademark, you
          can file a trademark report. Don't target the person who posted it by
          posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation because
          that may be classified as harassment. • We may work with law
          enforcement, including when we believe that there's risk of physical
          harm or threat to public safety. For more information, see our Help
          Centre and Terms of Use.

        <h5>Data policy</h5>
        <p>
          This Policy describes the information we process to support Drmurs, Paarambariyam and other products and features offered by
          Iconic Dream Focus (Iconic Dream Focus Products or Products). You can
          find additional tools and information in Drmurs settings.
        </p>
        <h5>What kinds of information do we collect?</h5>
        <p>
          To provide the Iconic Dream Focus Products, we must process
          information about you. The type of information that we collect depends
          on how you use our Products.
          <h5>Things that you and others do and provide.</h5>•<p></p> <p></p>
          Information and content you provide. We collect the content,
          communications and other information you provide when you use our
          Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share
          content and message or communicate with others. This can include
          information in or about the content that you provide (e.g. metadata),
          such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can
          also include what you see through features that we provide, such as
          our camera, so we can do things such as suggest masks and filters that
          you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems
          automatically process content and communications that you and others
          provide to analyse context and what's in them for the purposes
          described below. • Data with special protections: You can choose to
          provide information in your Iconic Dream Focus profile fields or life
          events about your religious views, political views, who you are
          "interested in" or your health. This and other information (such as
          racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union
          membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of
          your country. • Networks and connections. We collect information about
          the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups that you are
          connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such
          as people you communicate with the most or groups that you are part
          of. • Your usage. We collect information about how you use our
          Products, such as the types of content that you view or engage with,
          the features you use, the actions you take, the people or accounts you
          interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your activities.
          For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products,
          and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We
          also collect information about how you use features such as our
          camera. • Thing’s others do and information they provide about you. We
          also receive and analyse content, communications and information that
          other people provide when they use our Products. This can include
          information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo
          of you, send a message to you or upload, sync or import your contact
          information.
          <h5>Device information.</h5>
          <p>
            As described below, we collect information from and about the
            computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you
            use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this
            information across different devices you use. For example, we use
            information collected about your use of our Products on your phone
            to better personalise the content (including ads) or features that
            you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your
            laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in
            response to an ad that we showed you on your phone on a different
            device. Information we obtain from these devices includes:
          </p>
          • Device attributes: information such as the operating system,
          hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength,
          available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types,
          and plugins. • Device operations: information about operations and
          behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is in the
          foreground or background, or mouse movements (which can help
          distinguish humans from bots). • Identifiers: unique identifiers,
          device IDs and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts
          that you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to
          Iconic Dream Focus Company Products associated with the same device or
          account). • Device signals: Bluetooth signals, information about
          nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and mobile phone masts. • Data
          from device settings: information you allow us to receive through
          device settings that you turn on, such as access to your GPS location,
          camera or photos. • Network and connections: information such as the
          name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone
          number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information
          about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do
          things such as help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.
          Information from partners. Advertisers, app developers and publishers
          can send us information through Iconic Dream Focus Business Tools that
          they use, including our social plugins (such as the Like button),
          Iconic Dream Focus Login, our APIs and SDKs. These partners provide
          information about your activities off Iconic Dream Focus – including
          information about your device, websites you visit, the ads you see and
          how you use their services – whether or not you have an Drmurs
          account. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us
          what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you
          made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and
          offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have
          the rights to provide us with your information. Partners receive your
          data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties
          that they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful
          rights to collect, use and share your data before providing us with
          any data. II. How do we use this information? We use the information
          that we have (subject to choices you make) as described below, and to
          provide and support the Iconic Dream Focus Products and related
          services described in the Drmurs Terms. Here's how: Provide,
          personalise and improve our Products. We use the information we have
          to deliver our Products, including to personalise features and content
          (including your Memoir, Drmurs Instant Moments(stories) and
          ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be
          interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our
          Products. To create personalised Products that are unique and relevant
          to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities
          based on the data that we collect and learn from you and others
          (including any data with special protections you choose to provide);
          how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places or
          things that you're connected to and interested in on and off our
          Products. • Location-related information: We use location-related
          information – such as your current location, where you live, the
          places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near – to
          provide, personalise and improve our Products, including ads, for you
          and others. Location-related information can be based on things such
          as precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP
          addresses and information from your and others' use of Iconic Dream
          Focus Products (such as check-ins or events you attend). • Product
          research and development: We use the information we have to develop,
          test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and
          research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features. •
          Ads and other sponsored content: We use the information we have about
          you – including information about your interests, actions and
          connections – to select and personalise ads, offers and other
          sponsored content that we show you. Providing measurement, analytics
          and other business services. We use the information we have (including
          your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads
          you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the
          effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and
          understand the types of people who use their services and how people
          interact with their websites, apps and services. Promote safety,
          integrity and security. We use the information that we have to verify
          accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam
          and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and
          promote safety and security on and off Iconic Dream Focus Products.
          For example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious
          activity or violations of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when
          someone needs help. Communicate with you. We use the information that
          we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you
          about our Products and let you know about our Policies and Terms. We
          also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
          Researching and innovating for social good. We use the information we
          have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct
          and support research and innovation on topics of general social
          welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and
          well-being. For example, we analyse information we have about
          migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts III. How is
          this information shared? Your information is shared with others in the
          following ways: Sharing on Iconic Dream Focus Products People and
          accounts that you share and communicate with When you share and
          communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you
          share. For example, when you post on Iconic Dream Focus, you select
          the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the
          public or a customised list of people. Public information can be seen
          by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an
          account. This includes your Drmurs username, any information
          you share with a public audience, information in your public profile
          on Drmurs, and content you share in. You, other people using
          Drmurs, and we can provide access to or send public
          information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other
          Iconic Dream Focus Company Products, in search results or through
          tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed,
          reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search
          engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and
          other services that integrate with our Products. Content that others
          share or reshare about you. You should consider who you choose to
          share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products
          can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including
          people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For
          example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends
          or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to
          others across or off our Products. Also, when you comment on someone
          else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is
          visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that
          person can change the audience later. People can also use our Products
          to create and share content about you with the audience they choose.
          For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or
          tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in
          their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others
          have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the
          content. New owner. If the ownership or control of all or part of our
          Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to
          the new owner. Sharing with third-party partners We work with
          third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or
          who use Iconic Dream Focus Business Tools to grow their businesses,
          which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free
          services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your
          information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict
          restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we
          provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information
          with: Partners who use our analytics services. We provide aggregated
          statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how
          people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and
          other content on and off the Iconic Dream Focus Products. For example,
          Page admins and Drmurs business profiles receive information
          about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or
          commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other
          information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or
          account. Advertisers. We provide advertisers with reports about the
          kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but
          we don't share information that personally identifies you (information
          such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to
          contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.
          For example, we provide general demographic and interest information
          to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between
          the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madurai and likes software
          engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also
          confirm which Iconic Dream Focus ads led you to make a purchase or
          take an action with an advertiser. Measurement partners. We share
          information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide
          analytics and measurement reports to our partners. Partners offering
          goods and services in our Products. When you subscribe to receive
          premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the
          content creator or seller can receive your public information and
          other information that you share with them, as well as the information
          needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact
          details. Vendors and service providers. We provide information and
          content to vendors and service providers who support our business,
          such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how
          our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating
          payments or conducting surveys. Researchers and academics. We also
          provide information and content to research partners and academics to
          conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that
          supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and innovation
          on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public
          interest, health and well-being. Law enforcement or legal requests. We
          share information with law enforcement or in response to legal
          requests in the circumstances outlined below. Learn more about how you
          can control the information about you that you or others share with
          third-party partners in the Drmurs settings. IV. How do the
          Iconic Dream Focus Companies work together? Iconic Dream Focus and
          Drmurs share infrastructure, systems and technology with other
          Iconic Dream Focus Companies (which include Paarambariyam and AI) to
          provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across
          all Iconic Dream Focus Company Products that you use. We also process
          information about you across the Iconic Dream Focus Companies for
          these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with
          their Terms and Policies. We also work to understand how people use
          and interact with Iconic Dream Focus Company Products, such as
          understanding the number of unique users on different Iconic Dream
          Focus Company Products. V. How do we respond to legal requests or
          prevent harm? We access, preserve and share your information with
          regulators, law enforcement or others: • In response to a legal
          request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a
          good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include
          responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United
          States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required
          by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is
          consistent with internationally recognised standards. • When we have a
          good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address
          fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or
          Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves
          (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including
          as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death
          or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide
          information to and receive information from third-party partners about
          the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other
          harmful activity on and off our Products. Information we receive about
          you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made
          with Iconic Dream Focus) can be accessed and preserved for an extended
          period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation,
          governmental investigation or investigations of possible violations of
          our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain
          information from accounts disabled for term breaches for at least a
          year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches. VI. How will we
          notify you of changes to this Policy? We'll notify you before we make
          changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the
          revised Policy before you choose to continue using our Products. VII.
