      <h5>Can I have access to my teen’s Drmurs account?</h5>
      <p>
        We appreciate your concern for your child's use of our app, but
        unfortunately, we can't give you access to the account or take any
        action on the account at your request. We're generally forbidden by
        privacy laws against giving unauthorized access to someone who isn't an
        account holder. Please note that all users ages 13 and older are
        considered authorized account holders and are included in the scope of
        this policy. Instagram requires everyone to be at least 13 years old
        before they create an account (in some areas, the age limit may be
        higher).
