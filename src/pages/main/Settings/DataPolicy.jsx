        content (including ads) or features that you see when you use our
        Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure
        whether you took an action in response to an ad that we showed you on
        your phone on a different device. Information we obtain from these

        time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in
